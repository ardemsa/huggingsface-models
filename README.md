# huggingface models

With repository I am exploring different ways of using downstream models for inference as well as fine-tuning them on benchmark datasets. 


### How to use? Either prepare a docker environment or install poetry locally, then:

```
poetry install

poetry shell

python -m jupyterlab

```
